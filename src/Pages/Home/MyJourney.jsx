          <br />Having little exposure to Christianity in my childhood, I grew up as an atheist and centered my identity in political conservatism. With struggles during the pandemic, I began praying and met wonderful people from the church. Last Easter Vigil, on April 8th, 2023, I was baptized and confirmed at my Newman center at the University of Washington.
          <br /><br />Mother Angelica points out wasted suffering in the Bible. “If I give away all that I possess, piece by piece, and if I even let them take my body to burn it, <b><u>but am without love</u></b>, it will do me no good whatever.” (1 Cor. 13:3, emph. added). Paradoxically, this war with 73 million souls lost every year can only be won with peace and love. That love is in Christ.
          <br /><br />I have a decent physical background, running ever since I can remember and recently biking 700 miles across Kansas and Missouri in 6 days as a missionary for Biking for Babies. I believe this is physically possible for me as it has been for others.
